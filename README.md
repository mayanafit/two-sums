# two-sums

two sums function is a function to find two elements that if the two elements are added, will return the same value as required target. Assumption, it's only one solution for each target and we can't use the same element twice.

example: 
```
const arr = [1, 3, 5, 7]
const target = 4
```
solution will be in form of array with value of arr's index.
```
const solution = [0, 1]
```

to check: 
1. node index.js at /two-sums folder.
